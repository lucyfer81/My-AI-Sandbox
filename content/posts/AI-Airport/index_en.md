##Hey, AI makes me feel like I can do big things

Recently, I have been fascinated by using AI models to do things that are "beyond my ability", and I feel like an adventurer who can do it. This time I wanted to try taking an "airport", but what happened? The process was full of twists and turns and I fell a lot, but it also allowed me to see clearly the true nature of AI-it is both an artifact and a "trap". In this note, I want to talk about my turbulent experience, analyze why I stumbled, share how I use AI to learn new things across borders, and how AI can help us ordinary people make life more interesting.

###My "Airport Building" Rollover Story

As a technical whiz, taking the "airport" is similar to landing on the moon to me. As a result, relying on the guidance of the AI model, I rented a VPS, installed a V2Ray according to the tutorial, and chose a simple protocol. Hey, it really started running! This is a miracle for me. I feel like I'm all away from a "hacker".

But I am worried that this "airport" is not strong and can easily be blocked. So I ran to ask AI again. I never missed any large model that could be tried on the market, whether domestic or foreign, I asked every single one. They all said in unison: Upgrade to the Vless protocol, add reality technology, and use Cloudflare's CDN (a service that helps you hide network traffic) is absolutely safe and covert. When I heard this, wow, I'm sure! So I spent all my spare time on it for two days. The configuration files were changed again and again, and my brain was dizzy from changing them, but it still didn't work out.

What's even more outrageous is that an AI asked me to use a web tool to automatically generate configurations, promising that I could turn on reality and TLS (an encryption method) at the same time. But when I tried it, these two options couldn't be opened at the same time in the tool! Only then did I remember that other AI had previously said that these two things could be used together, and even told me a bunch of theories that "reality does not need certificates, TLS requires certificates." Why didn't I feel anything wrong at the time? It was not until this contradiction emerged that I was completely confused and angry that I wanted to break the keyboard: What's wrong with your AI? That was not what we said at the beginning!

##Why did I fall so badly?

Calm down and think about it, why did this thing fall over? I thought about three reasons:

1. ** I'm so lame **: I have a vague understanding of Linux and network protocols, and I believe whatever AI says. The success of using V2Ray for the first time made me feel inflated. I felt that every word of AI was a golden rule. As a result, Vless fell sharply.
2. **AI can "talk nonsense"**: AI models sometimes "hallucinate", and the suggestions they give seem reasonable, but in fact they are not right at all. Especially niche technologies like V2Ray, their training data may not be enough, and the answers may easily deviate.
3. ** I didn't verify it **: I followed the AI steps and didn't think of checking official documents or asking technical forums. If it had been verified earlier, two days of hard work wouldn't have been in vain.

Does this mean that AI is not reliable and Xiaobai can't rely on it to learn complex things? No! Although it took 3 days. But in the past, I might not even have dared to think about it. Now I have been using it for 3 days, and it actually works. Isn't this the charm of AI?

##How to use AI to learn new things across borders

After a round of trouble, I summarized some of the "tricks" of using AI. I hope you will not step in the pits when trying:

1. ** Ask questions with a little "careful"*: Don't just ask "how to do this", tell more about who you are and what you want to do. For example,"I am a novice and want to learn to build a simple website. Tell me step-by-step." If you give more background, AI's answers will be more reliable.
2. ** Take notes, don't rely all on your brain **: AI's answers sometimes fight back and forth, so write down what you talk about each time (I use Obsidian+webdav). Multi-platform synchronization is also taught by AI.), If you find something wrong, turn it back and ask again.
3. ** Ask a few more AIs **: Different AIs give different paths. For example, when learning to draw, some recommend using Procreate, and some say try AI generation tools. After comparison, you can always pick out reliable ones.
4. ** Checking and synchronization **: What AI says may not be everything right. If you have any questions, you can go to the official website, tutorial, or ask the big shots on Zhihu and Reddit, which can save you a lot of trouble.

##How can AI help us cross-border play

Many people are always worried about AI taking jobs, but I think this issue is too negative. AI is obviously a "super plug-in" for ordinary people, allowing us to do things that we didn't even dare to think about before. Give a few examples:

- ** Want to learn programming? ** Let AI write you the code for Mini games, change it while running, and you can understand some basic logic in a few days. I tried asking AI to write a greedy snake, but changing it was quite addictive.
- ** Want to design? ** Tell the AI you want a "retro poster" and it will recommend tools, color matching, and even directly generate a draft for your reference.
- ** Want to learn a foreign language? ** AI can be your language partner, accompany you to practice spoken English, and change grammar easily. I have a friend who has practiced English using AI for two months, but he dares to chat with foreigners.

Although my "building the airport" overturned this time, it ultimately succeeded. Isn't this the magic of AI? It makes me dare to venture into new fields.

##Finally: Open up a new world with AI

The AI model is like a portable "military strategist". It may not be reliable every time, but it can definitely take you flying. Whether you want to learn to cook, write novels, or fool around with technology like me, try asking AI and take the first step. You will find that AI is not just a tool, but also a "magic wand" that makes you dare to think and do.

So, find something you have always wanted to try but didn't dare to do, ask the AI, and try it! Maybe you'll be the one to share the story of a rollover next time-but who knows, maybe you'll have a big surprise!
