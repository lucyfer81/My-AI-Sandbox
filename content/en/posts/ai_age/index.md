title: Does AI also have age discrimination?
---


** Hello everyone, I am Old V. A very unprofessional AI non-geek. **

This morning, I made coffee, sat down in front of the computer, and turned on the AI news that Grok had sent me over the past 24 hours. Two diametrically opposed news items attracted my interest.

One is:

```
What A.I. Really Means for Learning

Key Point: AI tools like ChatGPT contribute to a "poverty of imagination" in education, requiring new strategies to mitigate.

Abstract: The discussion emphasizes AI's impact on creativity in classrooms, proposing fixes to harness its benefits while preserving innovative thinking.
```

Okay, should we restrict AI use among teenagers?

Another said:
```
How Older People Are Reaping Brain Benefits From New Tech

Key Point: Technology, including AI, supports cognitive health in older adults, contrasting its effects on younger users.

Abstract: While digital overuse harms teens, AI-driven tools may enhance mental sharpness for seniors, promoting positive tech adoption.
```

Okay, should we encourage older people to use AI apps?

** Does AI also have age discrimination? *

Of course not. In fact, we can also feel ourselves that generative AI (especially ChatGPT-like large language models) is reshaping education: tasks such as writing and conception can be completed with one click. My son is only in the first grade, and he will also hold his iPad and ask Doubao questions: Doubao, what is XXX? Bean buns, why XXX? Some people regard it as a tool for efficiency, while others worry that it will lead to "outsourcing of thinking." I agree that when users rely too much on AI's "consensus-based" suggestions, they can easily slide towards averaged and predictable ideas, thus weakening divergent thinking-this is the so-called "imagination poverty."

However, ** The focus is on the word "dependence"*. For example, with my current knowledge structure, wanting to learn quantum mechanics is tantamount to fantasy. I want to know something about this, either go to the Internet to find some popular science articles or ask about AI models. Which method is not dependent?

At the same time, I rely on AI to help me organize my usual project meeting minutes, let it help me sort out the project plan, and check for gaps in project design, which is also very beneficial for me to reduce my workload. What shouldn't be is that I completely rely on its output and hand it over without reviewing it at all. That would really be called "dependence".

When I asked Grok to dig deeper into the related reports of the first news, I found that everyone was paying attention to this:

| study/case             | central concerns    | summary of the results                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MIT Media Laboratory (2025.6)| Brain activity and memory| 54 subjects used ChatGPT to write SAT compositions, and their EEG alpha waves (creativity) and theta waves (memory) decreased significantly; the composition themes converged (career success, charity);83% were unable to recite the sentences they had written afterwards, exposing "cognitive debt." |
| Cornell University             | Cultural writing tips| American and Indian students wrote "My Favorite Food/Festival", and the AI answers were highly similar: pizza, Christmas, and local details (such as Indian rice ingredients) disappeared.                                              |
| Santa Clara University (2024)     | Creative conception tasks| Asked subjects to improve products or imagine a "weak gravity world", the ChatGPT group's ideas had high semantic similarity and low originality, and gradually entered the "curatorial mode".                                          |
| Social media anecdotes              | story writing    | The teacher found that middle school students used AI to generate original character stories without personal changes, and their early imagination was eroded;AI illusions misled students ("Moses helped T-shirts remove chocolate stains").                                 |
| Ghana University of Science and Technology (2023)      | curriculum design    | 125 undergraduate students used ChatGPT in a flipped classroom, and their critical thinking and creativity improved significantly; but in areas where policies are lacking, the risk of dependence remains high.                                        |

This is just college students. For junior high school and high school students, their understanding of three views requires the guidance of parents and teachers. At their age, it would be really not a good thing to ask AI to write essays with "empty souls".

** So what about AI's help to the elderly? **

It is said that AI helps the elderly brain maintain vitality through the dual mechanism of "compensation + activation". Studies show these effects

| Cases/studies                   | sample size               | key finding                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| New York Times 2025 meta-analysis         | 57 studies, 411,000 + elderly people| 90% show that technology use is associated with slowing cognitive decline|
| Nature MCI Prediction Model (2025)| Clinical data training AI          | Identify MCI in advance to pave the way for individualized intervention   |
| AI Hearing Aid Research (2025)          | High-risk elderly              | Reduced risk of cognitive decline by 50%        |
| Overview of Ghana SAR robots (2022, continuously updated)| systematic review               | Socially assisted robots significantly improve cognitive function     |
| Senior Planet True Story      | 67-year-old lecturer Wanda Woods| "Teaching AI keeps me sharp" resonates with users|



It is more significant for the elderly 65+ and 75+.

This was unexpected to me. When I get home, I have to give my parents the next APP so that they can chat with AI models when they have nothing to do.
