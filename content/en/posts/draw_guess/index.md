Hello everyone, I am Old V. A very unprofessional AI non-geek.
Today I bring you another boring little app of mine

! [UI](Draw_Guess.png)
Please ignore my ugly paintings. Focus on this Mini games that I think are a bit creative but really boring. This idea CLaude took 5 minutes to code and was deployed on Cloudflare. The only drawback is... Bad guess.
You can comment. My painting is really poor, but does this have anything to do with coffee?

So more work will be spent on making it smarter.
1) Handle it first after you finish drawing (I don't quite understand why, but what Cluade Code said must be right)
2) Change the prompt words. Be gentle and persuasive
3) Change the model. This small project is based entirely on Cloudflare's free resources, including AI. The first time ClaudeCode found a pure text model, and the second time he slapped himself in the face and said he would help me change it for another one.
4) Models generally speak English, so it needs to add bilingual English and Chinese. And adopt a vague strategy, and you can guess correctly if you are similar.

Now he is correcting, and I am writing this article. This week's challenge is a bit of a challenge, let's laugh it off.
What do you think of 100 AI-light applications? Give me a question and I'll do it?
