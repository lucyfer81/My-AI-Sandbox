Hello everyone! As a passionate observer of AI technology, I have just compiled important news in the AI field in the past 24 hours and discovered some very interesting and noteworthy developments that I can't wait to share with you.

## AI Business Applications: AI is becoming the new engine of business growth

### Palantir improves revenue forecast due to AI needs
Palantir Technologies Inc. has achieved a lot in the AI field. The company raised its 2025 revenue forecast for the second time, which is expected to be between $4.14 billion and $4.15 billion, an increase from its previous forecast of $3.9 billion to $3.9 billion. Total revenue for the second quarter was approximately US$1 billion, of which U.S. government sales increased 53% to US$426 million, accounting for more than 42% of total revenue. Stocks rose 4% in after-hours trading and have doubled in value this year, reflecting investors 'confidence in AI-driven growth. This shows that the application of AI technology in the commercial field can not only improve the efficiency of enterprises, but also bring significant economic benefits.

### Delta Airlines 'use of AI to price tickets sparks controversy
Delta Air Lines has become the first major airline to use AI technology to set ticket prices, and plans to cover AI pricing to 20% of domestic flights by the end of the year, up from 3%. However, the move sparked criticism from lawmakers over concerns that AI could conduct personalized pricing based on personal data. Delta clarified that it does not use AI to set prices on personal data, but the controversy continues. This has triggered us to think about the ethical issues of AI in commercial applications. How to use AI to improve efficiency while protecting the rights and interests of consumers is an issue that needs to be solved urgently.

### Amazon invests in Fable's Showrunner platform
Amazon's Alexa Fund has invested in Fable's Showrunner platform, known as the "Netflix of AI," which allows users to create animated series and episodes with prompts. This not only demonstrates the potential of AI in entertainment content generation, but also allows us to see the application prospects of AI technology in the creative industry. In the future, we may be able to see more personalized and interactive entertainment content generated by AI.

## AI Technology Advances: Breakthroughs in Open Source Models and Infrastructure

### Tencent releases open source Hunyuan AI model
Tencent has released the multi-functional open source Hunyuan AI model, which is suitable for various application scenarios and aims to provide developers with efficient and customizable AI tools. This step enhances the diversity of the open source AI ecosystem, provides developers with more choices and possibilities, and helps promote the further development of AI technology.

### Deep Cogito v2 improves reasoning skills
The release of Deep Cogito v2 is another milestone in the field of open source AI, significantly improving reasoning capabilities, suitable for more complex decision-making and problem solving scenarios, and is expected to attract a wide range of developers and researchers. This shows that AI technology is constantly improving, being able to handle more complex tasks and providing more powerful tools for solving practical problems.

### SNIA launches Storage.AI project
The Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) has announced the Storage.AI project, which aims to optimize AI workloads through open standards and address challenges such as latency, space, power, memory and cost. Initial participants include industry leaders such as AMD, Cisco, Dell, IBM, Intel, and Micron, with the goal of creating an efficient, non-proprietary AI data services ecosystem. This project is expected to promote innovation in AI technology in data storage and management and provide a more solid foundation for the widespread application of AI.

##Policy and social impact: AI's global influence continues to expand

###Trump administration considers replacing AI export controls
The Trump administration is evaluating replacing Biden's AI export control policies and may take a more moderate stance due to recent trade deals with China. The move involves the balance between national security and economic interests of AI technology (such as AI chips) and is still under discussion within the White House and the Commerce Department. This reflects the importance of AI technology in international relations and trade, as well as the competition and cooperation among countries in the field of AI.

### AI affects the job market for American college graduates
AI is replacing entry-level positions in consulting and software engineering, leading to a decline in first-time labor participation among college graduates in 2023. New employees need AI skills, a transformation that has been described as "chaotic" and reflects AI's impact on traditional employment structures. This reminds us that with the development of AI technology, the labor market is also changing, and we need to adapt to these changes and improve our skills to remain competitive.

###China universities promote AI education
In China, 60% of college students and faculty members frequently use generative AI tools (such as multiple times a day or week), which is considered a necessary part of mastering AI skills. Due to the unavailability of Western tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude), local tools such as DeepSeek have been widely adopted, reflecting the development of China's unique AI ecosystem. This shows that the application and development of AI technology on a global scale presents different characteristics and trends, and all countries are promoting the popularization and application of AI technology according to their own conditions.

##Environmental challenge: AI's energy consumption cannot be ignored

### AI's energy needs may lead to rising electricity bills
Experts warn that AI-powered data centers could account for 12% of U.S. electricity consumption within five years, which could lead to an increase in consumer bills. Jeffrey Shaffer, director of the Applied AI Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati's Lindner School of Business, pointed out that AI is expected to contribute trillions of dollars to the global economy and help combat climate change, but its energy needs have begun to affect costs for some consumers. He suggested exploring green solutions such as nuclear energy, and believed that AI's energy needs were difficult to accurately predict because models might optimize themselves in the future without human intervention. This reminds us that the development of AI technology not only needs to consider its economic benefits, but also needs to pay attention to its impact on the environment and seek a sustainable development path.

##Conclusion
The past 24 hours of AI news have shown us the widespread use of AI technology at the business, technology development, policy and social levels, while also exposing challenges such as energy consumption and ethical disputes. In the future, the sustainable development of AI will become a key issue. While promoting technological innovation, we need to pay attention to its impact on society and the environment, and seek solutions that balance innovation and social responsibility. I hope these news can help you better understand the latest developments in the AI field. Everyone is also welcome to share their opinions and insights in the comment area, so that we can discuss the future development of AI together!
